# PlotlyDiploy

## Project Overview

In this module, we will use Plotly.js, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create an interactive data visualization for the web. 

## Resources

* Data Source: index.html, samples.json, plots.js
* Software: VS Code, Web browser, Command-line interface, GitHub

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge, we have a partially completed dashboard, but need to finish it. We have a completed panel for demographic information and now need to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, the volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, our volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in quantity in their navel.

## Challenge Summary

When an individualâ€™s ID is selected, the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) should be visualized with a bar chart. Create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.
Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.
Use otu_labels as the hover text for the chart.
